#  Bubble sort

_Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm that works by swapping the elements that are in the wrong order. In multiple passes, it checks if the adjacent elements are in the right order (increasing) or not_

_The Time Complexity of the Bubble Sort is ***O(n^2)*** since it takes two nested loops to check the adjacent element._

_For example, letâ€™s take the following unsorted array_

`22 15 11 45 13`

_Bubble Sort Algorithm first traverses the whole array and then in another loop checks if the adjacent elements are in order or not._

_Thus, after sorting the elements will be,_

`11 13 15 22 45`

### _Algorithm_

* **_In two nested loops, compare each element with its adjacent element._**

* **_Swap the element if it is less than the previous element._**

_Implementation of Bubble Sort Algorithm_
```go

package main
import "fmt"
func BubbleSort(array[] int)[]int {
   for i:=0; i< len(array)-1; i++ {
      for j:=0; j < len(array)-i-1; j++ {
         if (array[j] > array[j+1]) {
            array[j], array[j+1] = array[j+1], array[j]
         }
      }
   }
   return array
}
func main() {
   array:= []int{11, 14, 3, 8, 18, 17, 43};
   fmt.Println(BubbleSort(array))
}
